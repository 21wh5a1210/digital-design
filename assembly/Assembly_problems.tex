 A portion of an assembly language program written for an $8$-bit microprocessor is given below along with explanations. The code is intended to introduce a software time delay. The processor is driven by a $5$ MHz clock. The time delay (in $\mu$s) introduced by the program is \vspace{12 pt}


MVI B, $64$H; Move immediate the given byte into register B. Takes $7$ clock periods.\vspace{12 pt}


LOOP: DCR B ; Decrement register B. Affects Flags. Takes $4$ clock periods. \vspace{12 pt}


JNZ LOOP ; Jump to address with Label LOOP if zero flag is not set. Takes $10$ clock periods when jump is performed and $7$ clock periods when jump is not performed.

\item A $10\frac{1}{2}$ digit Counter-timer is set in the 'frequency mode' of operation (with $T_s=1s$). For a specific input, the reading obtained is $1000$. Without disconnecting this input, the Counter-timer is changed to operate in the 'Period mode' and the range selected is microseconds ($\mu$s,with $f_s=\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}$).The Counter Will then display
